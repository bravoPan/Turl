## Tech Stack
- Lanuage: TS, JSX/TSX
- DB: Firebase
- Auth: next-auth, github oauth provider
- Unit Test: Jest
- UI: Next UI
- Redirection: nextjs middleware (due to vercel edge function limitation for free hosting, redirection can only be triggered 5s a time). Also check the url [matching order](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware#matching-paths) for how it works.
- hosting: vercel
- algorithm: thanks to [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-design-a-tiny-url-or-url-shortener/)
